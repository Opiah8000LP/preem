// ============================================================
//  MOCK BOT: a poke at the useless "AI assistants" every site has now.
//  It is confident, it is polite, and it is never helpful.
//
//  Two parts:
//   1) The floating line at the top of the screen (random lines, reacts to songs / typing)
//   2) The CHAT window (MOCK BOT button in the top bar) with full conversations
//
//  Emotion tags work in any line:  <angry> <shy> <sad> <happy> <excited> <scared> <whisper>
//  <yell> <sleepy> <love> <silly> <spooky> <dizzy> <glitch> <cold> <rich> <sneaky> <nervous>
//  <proud> <sing>   and <n> to go back to normal, <wait> for a pause.
//  Placeholders: {boss} {t} (song title) {by} (" by artist") {n} (visit number)
